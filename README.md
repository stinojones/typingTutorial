# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Austin Jones

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?      

             1st Sprint

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java          (node.js)  |       x       |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write one or more programs in Java that demonstrates some of the following:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Modify your program to read and write to a file.

Modify your program to demonstrate inheritance using the extends and abstract keywords.

Modify your program to create an interface and then use it with the implements keyword.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

Chatgpt, leetcode, youtube

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

Week 1
Monday: Day of Planning
Tuesday: Install IDE, Hello World
Wednesday: Study Material Tutorial Following
Thursday: Start you're own Work with Project
Friday: Update Project depedning on feedback at class
Saturday: 
Sunday: 
Monday: Add more to project, possibly stretch requirements
Tuesday: Explore bugs to fix, finish basic requirements
Wednesday: Revise any work that classmates think is necessary
Thursday: Double check requirements and stretch requirements
Friday: Finalize Project Edits and Bugs

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
I want to do either a flappy bird type of game or a skateboarding game that jumps over obstacles and can grind on some. Possibly do tricks as well. 

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
Above I have the days set, but locations will be at the library somewhere quiet or at the stc in between my classes during my break. I'll also go to the library after classes at 2. 

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
A Technical risk is the project being to big for me in this sprint. Behavioral risk is not working on it each day. For the project size risk.
Mitigation Plan: Space out the work I do each day rather than a lot at once. This will be beneficial to both risks honestly. 

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|   May 1  |  11:35am |   IM   |  Installed IDE & Node.Js, did hello world  |    2 hour   |
|   May 2  |  9:51pm  |   IM   |           Followed Tutorial                |    2 hour   |
|   May 2  |  2:00pm  |   TP   |        Created team Presentation           |    1 hour   |

|   May 9  |  6:30pm  |   IM   |          Creating in Node.JS               |    2 hour   |


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

    https://github.com/stinojones/typingTutorial 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

    https://youtu.be/vvAng15eFwU


3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   yes                                       |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   I think so, ran into some bugs with mysql |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   yes                                       |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   yes                                       |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   yes                                       |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

Yes, I originally was going to do game framework. My team project was doing more with node.js so I decide to switch to that and also learn how to connect mysql servers alongside that

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       8           |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

I think changing to what helps for the team was beneficial. I thinnk what didn't work well with that was I wasn't having as much fun or motivation for it since it wasn't a personal choice. Moreso for the team help. I think choosing something more that I'd want to do for fun and managaebale for my skill level would be good. I also think that following better tutroials would be better. I'll definetly use the videos that are posted on the canvas page for help rather than just youtube.
